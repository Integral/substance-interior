<div class="content campaign">

<p>
  Hello. This is the team behind Substance speaking. If you haven't heard of it, Substance is an open source platform that aims at making working with digital documents easier.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://substance.io">Substance</a> is developed around the idea that content is data. While traditional text editors usually deal with visual information (emulating its representations on paper), Substance is only interested in its substance, allowing documents to be stored and represented in numerous arbitrary ways. With Substance content, not only you will be able to maintain a website or blog, but also you will be able to represent the same content into ebook, pdf or mobile formats.
</p>
<p>
  The idea is simple:<br/>
  <b>Write once, publish everywhere.</b><br/>
  <b>Make a change, have everything updated immediately.</b><br/>
</p>

<h1>We need your help</h1>
<p>
  Over the last two years, Substance has grown into a large project and has gained a lot of attention. People have been contacting us expressing their wish to integrate Substance in their application use-cases. But sadly we have not yet reached a stage in which they could start using it and we'd love to change that!
</p>
<p>
  The goal of this campaign is to get Substance out of experimental state into a usable release. Weâ€™ve been developing Substance for two years now without any funding, making this a project fully built out of voluntary effort. However, the more concrete our goals get, the more we see the need to spend dedicated time on it, in order to come to the day when we can say &quot;It's finally here!&quot;.
</p>
<p>So what will be build with your support?</p>

<h3>Substance App</h3>
<p>This is how the <a href="http://interior.substance.io/modules/substance.html">Substance App</a> will probably look like when ready. We've come a long way, but it still needs much work to get to a solid release.
We will first release OSX and Linux builds, followed by Windows versions later on. Although Substance will be shipped as a native application, it is built on top of web technologies (HTML, Javascript, CSS).

</p>

<h3>Substance Hub</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://interior.substance.io/modules/hub.html">Substance Hub</a> will be the server piece of the Substance infrastructure. This is where your documents will be published, read and explored online.</p>

<h3>Substance Document</h3>
<p>
  <a href="http://interior.substance.io/modules/document.html">Substance Document</a> is a programmatic interface for creating and transforming digital documents. It ensures consistency, separates content from presentation and provides an easy to use API.

</p>

<h3>Substance Surface</h3>
<p>
  <a href="http://interior.substance.io/modules/surface.html">Substance Surface</a>is an in browser multi-line plain text editing control. It provides a low-level interface for general text manipulation, insertion, deletion et. al. and user-defined range based annotations. 
Surface exposes an API that will make it possible to build more complex text editors on top of it.

</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<p>
  The goal of this campaign is to ship a stable release of the full stack in July 2012. Over that time we'll release a number of open source components. Here's how our roadmap looks like.
</p>
<p>

</p>

<h2>And then?</h2>
<p>This campaign is just a starting point. Once we have a stable foundation is when things will become really exciting.</p>
<p>
  Here are a few of our next priorities:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>New content types (images, tables, lists ...)</li>
  <li>Plugin system (Extend Substance, create your own Content Types)</li>
  <li>Collaborative editing and sharing of documents with a selected number of people.</li>
  <li>Topic-related networks (Channels) for the Substance Hub so documents are easy to find.</li>
</ul>
<p>This basically means that if we manage to exceed our goals with the campaign, all the money will still be used for doing further work on Substance.</p>

<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>Our core team consists of three people (<a href="http://github.com/michael">Michael Aufreiter</a>, <a href="http://github.com/vectorsize">Victor Saiz</a>, <a href="http://github.com/oliver----">Oliver Buchtala</a>).</p>

  We would also like to thank <a href="http://ot.substance.io/">Tim Baumann</a> and <a href="http://vimeo.com/27730207">Remo Rauscher</a> for their contributions
