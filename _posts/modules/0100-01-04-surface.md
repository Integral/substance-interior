Surface is an extensible low-level interface for semantic rich text editing. It doesn't introduce any UI components, but an API for managing user-defined text annotations. It can be used as a foundation for text editors that support annotations.

# Try it out!

First off try the current version and see how it feels like beneath.

# Usage

## Create a new Surface

    var surface = new Substance.Surface({
      el: document.getElementById('content'),
      content: "Surface is an extensible low-level interface for semantic rich text editing",
      types: {
        "em": { "inclusive": true },
        "str": { "inclusive": true },
        "idea": { "inclusive": false },
        "question": { "inclusive": false },
        "error": { "inclusive": false }
      }
    });
        
The types are optional, they denote which annotations the Surface supports. Annotations are created using the corresponding API calls.

## Text interact

### Return current content

Usage: `surface.content`

The content variable always holds the current content represented as a string.

### Insert text

Usage: `surface.insertText(text, index)

You can insert text programatically by calling `insertText` and passing in a `text` string as well as an `index` specifying the position where text will be inserted.

## Selections

### Get current selection

Usage: `surface.selection()`

As a return value, you'll get an array holding start position and offset (e.g. `[4, 5]` when the selection starts at character 4 and includes 5 characters).

### Set selection programmatically

Usage: `surface.select(start, end)`

Instead of selecting text by mouse or keyboard navigation, you can do it programatically by calling `select` and passing in `start` and `end` position of the selected characters.

## Annotations

### Get Annotations

Usage: `surface.getAnnotations(selection, types)`

When called without a parameter all registered annotations are returned. You can optionally look at a specific text `selection` and optionally filter by annotation `types`.

The resulting annotations object looks like this:

	{
      "annotation-1" : { id: "annotation-1", type: "idea", pos: [0,9] },
      "annotation-1" : { id: "annotation-2", type: "em", pos: [57,10] }
    }

### Insert annotation

Registering a new annotation is easy.

    surface.insertAnnotation({
      id: "annotation-25",
      type: "idea",
      pos: [3, 5]
    });

### Delete annotation

Delete an annotation by providing its id.

	surface.deleteAnnotation(id);



### Highlight annotation

Usage: `surface.highlight()`

Sometimes you want one annotation to stand out. You can do this by calling `highlight`. Keep in mind this just adds a `.highlight` class to the corresponding characters. It's up to your stylesheet how a highlighted annotation differs from a regular one. 

## Events

### When selection changes

    surface.on('selection:changed', function(sel) {
      console.log('selected range', sel);
    });
    
### When content is updated

    surface.on('content:changed', function(content, prevContent) {
      console.log('updated text from', prevContent, 'to: ', content);
    });
    
    
# Notes

Surface is intentionally dumb. It doesn't do anything smart like detecting overlapping annotations and doesn't provide any UI components. That's by design since we realized it's very much application-specific how annotations are created and styled.

For the Substance Composer we added some code to detect overlaps. While a character can be marked as strong and marked as `idea`, you can't combine strong and emphasized or idea and error.

Here's how the code that we are using looks like:



    function annotate(type) {
      // Check for existing annotation
      var sel = this.surface.selection();

      if (!sel) return;

      if (_.include(["em", "str"], type)) {
        var types = ["em", "str"];
      } else {
        var types = ["idea", "blur", "doubt"];
      }

      var a = this.surface.getAnnotations(sel, types)[0];

      // Overlap
      if (a) {
        var start = sel[0];
        var end = start + sel[1];
        var aStart = a.pos[0];
        var aEnd = aStart + a.pos[1];

        if (start <= aStart && end >= aEnd) {
          // Full overlap
          if (a.type === type) {
            this.surface.deleteAnnotation(a.id);  
          } else {
            console.log('turning ', a.type, 'into ', type);
            this.surface.updateAnnotation({
              id: a.id,
              type: type
            });
          }
        } else {
          if (start <= aStart) {
            // Partial overlap left-hand side
            this.surface.updateAnnotation({
              id: a.id,
              pos: [end, a.pos[1] - (end - a.pos[0])],
            });
          } else if (start < aEnd && end >= aEnd) {
            // Partial overlap right-hand side
            this.surface.updateAnnotation({
              id: a.id,
              pos: [a.pos[0], start - aStart]
            });
          } else {
            // In the middle -> delete it
            this.surface.deleteAnnotation(a.id);
          }

          // If types differ create the new annotation
          if (a.type !== type) {
            console.log('inserting new annotation..');
            this.insertAnnotation(type, sel);
          }
        }
      } else {
        // Insert new annotation
        this.insertAnnotation(type, sel);
      }

      // this.removeToggles();
      this.renderToggles(sel);
    }
