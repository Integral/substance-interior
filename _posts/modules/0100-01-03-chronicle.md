Substance.Chronicle is a git-inspired versioning API based on Operational Transformations (OT). The actual content to be versioned or a persistence mechanism is not addressed in this module. Instead one would have to create an adapter which is implementing an OT interface.

Until we have proper documentation, please see the [testsuite](https://github.com/substance/chronicle/tree/master/tests) for usage examples.
